    "description": "<p>Just once again a weekday evening hike: This time from Spandau to Hennigsdorf, along the Havel river.</p> <p>We'll start at Spandau, walk through the historic \"Kolk\", cross the Island \"Eiswerder\" (with a nice view of the Citadel), pass by the \"Bürgerablage\" beach, go along the \"Berliner Mauerweg\" and pass by an old east German watchtower, while going mostly along the Havel river which is partially quite wide in this area.</p> <p>We'll meet on Wednesday at 6:30 PM at the subway station Altstadt Spandau. (Not S+U Spandau - that is one stop away from the meeting point).</p> <p>The hike will be about 16 km long. We should reach Hennigsdorf roughly at 9:45 PM - just at dawn.</p> <p>From Hennigsdorf, we can use the S25 to get back to Berlin. Note that Hennigsdorf is in the C-Area, so you need ABC tickets.</p> <p>Note:</p> <p>* Please be on time at the meeting point.<br/>* There probably won't be too many Späties along the route, so better bring some water and food with you.<br/>* You are all responsible for yourself.<br/>* It is planned to arrive just briefly after sunset at Hennigsdorf. Still, just in case, or if you want to extend the walk on your own, bring a flashlight with you.</p>",

He had many different roles from management consultant to service manager to software engineer, in just as many disciplines, infrastructure, outsourcing, testing and software development. He joined the startup Kong Inc in 2015 and is currently holding the position of Solutions Architect in the Office of the CTO at Kong Inc where he helps clients in making the transition to microservices.</p> <p>Twitter: @thekonginc, @thijsschreijer<br/>Linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thijsschreijer/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/thijsschreijer/</a><br/>Website: <a href=\"http://getkong.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://getkong.org</a></p> <p>PS: We will once again raffle one conference ticket for GOTO Berlin 2018 ! ;)</p>",

But soon you realize that you might also run some code to change the code itself, in a way that you can banish boilerplate from your life. This revelation opens up a whole new world of possibilities, where you're free to focus only on the fun parts, delivering business value from day one.<br/>That is the reason I started to write Appkernel (<a href=\"https://github.com/accelero-cloud/appkernel\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/accelero-cloud/appkernel</a>), a beautiful and opninionated python framework “for humans”, helping to deliver REST enabled micro-services from zero to production within minutes (no kidding: literally within minutes).

    "description": "<p>Update: We have to postpone the meetup as one of our speakers will not make it. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p> <p>Dear Webtrekkers,</p> <p>summer is here, and the roof-deck terrace is calling to us and we cannot help but answer the call with a good meetup. 20th of June we will welcome two speakers, who will give us some practical insights and tips on mobile analytics. We start again at 18:30 at the Webtrekk Headquarters, but this time please use the entry on Hannoversche Str. 19.</p> <p>Our speakers are:</p> <p>Ole Bahlmann, Product Manager for mobile at Webtrekk, will give you the scoop on customer journey attribution and what’s special when it comes to mobile analytics. He will address different attribution models, how misapplying them can hurt your business and what is important to keep in mind when thinking about your customer’s journey.</p> <p>Next up we have Gerrit Rode from 360 Dialog, who will detail what he learned in practice and how important it is to work out a concept in advance to assemble the data required to enable all the modern marketing hooplahoop, especially personalized lifecycle communication across mobile channels. Gerrit will showcase his insights with relevant case studies to show what’s possible and what is required.</p> <p>Food &amp; Drinks<br/>As always, we might not be the biggest meetup, but we strive to provide at least the best self-cooked peanut-butter-chili and fresh vegetable sticks with hummus. Softdrinks, water and beer are available.</p> <p>One small request: do not worry about space, if you want to come, we have enough space available, so please do not RSVP to just save yourself a space for the slight possibility that you might come, but rather do so, when you are reasonably sure that you will come. That would make preparations so much easier.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Women and femme coders will talk about more advanced topics in programming. We'll have three talks.</p> <p>The agenda for the evening:</p> <p>7:00 pm - Start: get yourself a drink and a snack<br/>7:35 pm - Community Announcements</p> <p>Talk 1 - Designers are from Mars, developers are from Venus, by Sonja Heinen<br/>Talk 2 - Data (Science) in Physical Sciences, by Uğur Ural<br/>Talk 3 - TBA</p> <p>10pm - End of the meetup</p> <p>About the talks:<br/>*Designers are from Mars, developers are from Venus*<br/>Digital products and services look better than ever, interfaces are intuitive and easy to use. Behind the shiny facades, designers and developers are working hand in hand to guarantee a great user experience. Both are responsible for the final product, and thus their relationship is put to the test. Colors are open to dispute, frameworks too, as long as that happens in an agile and pixel-perfect way.</p> <p>This talk examines the relationship between designers and developers within work environments. It's an attempt to raise empathy and respect for each other’s roles and perspectives.</p> <p>*Data (Science) in Physical Sciences*<br/>Data science is the hot topic of the moment, mainly focussing on specific software and tools to implement machine learning algorithms quickly and optimise customer experience or sales. Physical sciences on the other hand, have long been relying on scrutinising data analysis and modelling to understand the underlying factors and the physical processes.</p> <p>The talk will focus on a couple of projects:<br/>• Statistical modelling of the unknown mass of a galaxy, through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.<br/>• Global warming simulations based on greenhouse gases.</p> <p>About the speakers:<br/>*Sonja Heinen*<br/>Sonja is a visual designer and autodidactic developer, interested in the space where technology, art and society collide.<br/>She earned a BA in Communications Design and a MA in Sustainable Design from Kingston University in London, then relocated to Berlin.<br/>At the moment she works as a creative consultant for INNOQ and plays with Frontend technologies.</p> <p>*Uğur Ural*<br/>Uğur is a data scientist at Climate Analytics, doing quantitative analysis of climate policies and running global warming simulations based on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. She has a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Leicester and used to analyse, model and simulate data from galaxies before switching fields.</p>",
